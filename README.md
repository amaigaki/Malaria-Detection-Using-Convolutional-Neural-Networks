# Malaria-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This is my repository for Malaria Detection project which is based on Convolutional Neural networks. I learned a lot through working on this project and exploring the dataset of large number of images.

There are lot of different ways to detect Malaria but all of those require experienced professionals and it is done manually. So, having a Malaria Detection project which can process multiple blood cell images simultaneously and give results is beneficial.

Data description:
Total images: 27558
Parasitized cell images: 13779
Uninfected cell images: 13779

The project is still in progress, so here is the first release.
